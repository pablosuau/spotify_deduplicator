# spotify_deduplicator

Small project to detect duplicated playlist names for a given username.

I maintain a large backlog of albums as Spotify playlists. This project is aimed at helping me detect duplicated playlist names even in the presence of small differences. 

### How to use it

The script takes a JSON file as an input containing the user's playlist. This json file can be manually generated at https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlists/.
