# spotify_deduplicator

Small Flask project to detect (nearly) duplicated playlist names on Spotify.

I maintain a large backlog of albums as Spotify playlists. This project is aimed at helping me detect duplicated playlist names even in the presence of small differences. 

The application requires a `config.json` file. A template is provided as `config.json.template`.
