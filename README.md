# spotify_deduplicator

Small project to detect duplicated playlist names for a given username.

I maintain a large backlog of albums as Spotify playlists. This project is aimed at helping me detect duplicated playlist names even in the presence of small differences. 

You can get a temporary oauth key at https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlists/.
